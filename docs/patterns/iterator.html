						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						<b>Iterator</b> is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its
						underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						<img class="mh-4" src="../img/patterns/iterator/iterator.png" alt="">

						<div class="title_inner">

							Problem
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						Collections are one of the most used data types in programming. Nonetheless, a collection is just a
						container for a group of objects.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						<img class="mh-4" src="./assets/iterator/Different_graphs.svg" alt="">
					</p>
					<p>
						Most collections store their elements in simple lists. However, some of them are based on stacks, trees,
						graphs and other complex data structures.
					</p>
					<p>
						But no matter how a collection is structured, it must provide some way of accessing its elements so that
						other code can use these elements. There should be a way to go through each element of the collection
						without accessing the same elements over and over.
					</p>
					<p>
						This may sound like an easy job if you have a collection based on a list. You just loop over all of the
						elements. But how do you sequentially traverse elements of a complex data structure, such as a tree? For
						example, one day you might be just fine with depth-first traversal of a tree. Yet the next day you might
						require breadth-first traversal. And the next week, you might need something else, like random access to the
						tree elements.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						<img class="mh-4" src="./assets/iterator/Different_ways.svg" alt="">
					</p>
					<p>
						Adding more and more traversal algorithms to the collection gradually blurs its primary responsibility,
						which is efficient data storage. Additionally, some algorithms might be tailored for a specific application,
						so including them into a generic collection class would be weird.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, the client code that’s supposed to work with various collections may not even care how
						they store their elements. However, since collections all provide different ways of accessing their
						elements, you have no option other than to couple your code to the specific collection classes.
					</p>
					<div class="title">
						<div class="title_inner">
							<span class="ion ion-checkmark-circled"></span>
							Solution
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate
						object called an iterator.
					</p>
					<p class="center">
						<img class="mh-5" src="./assets/iterator/Graphs_and_Iterator.svg" alt="">
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to implementing the algorithm itself, an iterator object encapsulates all of the traversal
						details, such as the current position and how many elements are left till the end. Because of this, several
						iterators can go through the same collection at the same time, independently of each other.
					</p>
					<p>
						Usually, iterators provide one primary method for fetching elements of the collection. The client can keep
						running this method until it doesn’t return anything, which means that the iterator has traversed all of the
						elements.
					</p>
					<p>
						All iterators must implement the same interface. This makes the client code compatible with any collection
						type or any traversal algorithm as long as there’s a proper iterator. If you need a special way to traverse
						a collection, you just create a new iterator class, without having to change the collection or the client.

					<p>
						You plan to visit Rome for a few days and visit all of its main sights and attractions. But once there, you
						could waste a lot of time walking in circles, unable to find even the Colosseum.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the other hand, you could buy a virtual guide app for your smartphone and use it for navigation. It’s
						smart and inexpensive, and you could be staying at some interesting places for as long as you want.
					</p>
					<p>
						A third alternative is that you could spend some of the trip’s budget and hire a local guide who knows the
						city like the back of his hand. The guide would be able to tailor the tour to your likings, show you every
						attraction and tell a lot of exciting stories. That’ll be even more fun; but, alas, more expensive, too.
					</p>
					<p>
						All of these options—the random directions born in your head, the smartphone navigator or the human
						guide—act as iterators over the vast collection of sights and attractions located in Rome.

					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The <b>Iterator</b> interface declares the operations required for traversing a collection: fetching the next
							element, retrieving the current position, restarting iteration, etc.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Concrete Iterators</b> implement specific algorithms for traversing a collection. The iterator object should
							track the traversal progress on its own. This allows several iterators to traverse the same collection
							independently of each other.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <b>Collection</b> interface declares one or multiple methods for getting iterators compatible with the
							collection. Note that the return type of the methods must be declared as the iterator interface so that
							the concrete collections can return various kinds of iterators.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Concrete Collections</b> return new instances of a particular concrete iterator class each time the client
							requests one. You might be wondering, where’s the rest of the collection’s code? Don’t worry, it should be
							in the same class. It’s just that these details aren’t crucial to the actual pattern, so we’re omitting
							them.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <b>Client</b> works with both collections and iterators via their interfaces. This way the client isn’t
							coupled to concrete classes, allowing you to use various collections and iterators with the same client
							code.
							<br><br>
							Typically, clients don’t create iterators on their own, but instead get them from collections. Yet, in
							certain cases, the client can create one directly; for example, when the client defines its own special
							iterator.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="title">
						<div class="title_inner">
							<span class="ion ion-android-bulb"></span>
							Applicability
						</div>
					</div>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Use the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to
							hide its complexity from clients (either for convenience or security reasons).
						</li>
						<li>
							The iterator encapsulates the details of working with a complex data structure, providing the client with
							several simple methods of accessing the collection elements. While this approach is very convenient for
							the client, it also protects the collection from careless or malicious actions which the client would be
							able to perform if working with the collection directly.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use the pattern to reduce duplication of the traversal code across your app.
						</li>
						<li>
							The code of non-trivial iteration algorithms tends to be very bulky. When placed within the business logic
							of an app, it may blur the responsibility of the original code and make it less maintainable. Moving the
							traversal code to designated iterators can help you make the code of the application more lean and clean.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use the Iterator when you want your code to be able to traverse different data structures or when types of
							these structures are unknown beforehand.
						</li>
						<li>
							The pattern provides a couple of generic interfaces for both collections and iterators. Given that your
							code now uses these interfaces, it’ll still work if you pass it various kinds of collections and iterators
							that implement these interfaces.
						</li>
